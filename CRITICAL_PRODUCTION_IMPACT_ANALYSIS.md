## üéØ IMPACT ASSESSMENT: DISK CLEANUP

### **What We Planned to Clean:**

1. APT package cache
2. Unused packages
3. Old system logs (>7 days)
4. Large temporary files

### **Risk Analysis:**

#### **‚úÖ SAFE Operations (Zero Impact):**

**1. APT Package Cache Cleanup**
```bash
sudo apt-get clean
```
**Impact:** ZERO ‚úÖ
- Only removes downloaded .deb files
- Already installed packages unaffected
- All apps keep running
- Can re-download if needed

**2. Unused Package Removal**
```bash
sudo apt-get autoremove
```
**Impact:** MINIMAL ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Only removes packages NO app uses
- BUT: We should check carefully first
- Risk: Could remove something needed
- **Recommendation:** Skip this OR review very carefully

**3. Old System Logs Cleanup**
```bash
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=7d
```
**Impact:** ZERO ‚úÖ
- Only removes logs older than 7 days
- Apps don't read old logs
- System keeps running
- Logs are for debugging only

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è CAUTION Required:**

**4. Large File Review**
```bash
sudo du -ah /var/www | sort -rh | head -20
```
**Impact:** DEPENDS ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Need to review VERY carefully
- Could find:
  - ‚úÖ Old backups (safe to remove)
  - ‚úÖ Temp files (safe to remove)
  - ‚ùå Active databases (DO NOT TOUCH)
  - ‚ùå Uploaded files (DO NOT TOUCH)
  - ‚ùå Application data (DO NOT TOUCH)

**Recommendation:** Only remove files we're 100% sure are safe

---

## üéØ IMPACT ASSESSMENT: SWAP SPACE

### **What We Planned:**

Create 2GB swap file for emergency memory

### **Risk Analysis:**

#### **‚úÖ SAFE (Zero Impact):**

```bash
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

**Impact:** ZERO ‚úÖ
- Doesn't modify existing files
- Doesn't restart services
- Doesn't affect running apps
- Just creates new emergency memory
- Standard practice on all servers

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Protects ALL apps from memory crashes
- ‚úÖ Prevents OOM (Out Of Memory) kills
- ‚úÖ Makes server more stable
- ‚úÖ Especially important with 6+ apps running!

**Recommendation:** This is HIGHLY recommended for this server

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL CONCERNS

### **Concern 1: Shared Resource Pool**

**Problem:**
- 6 production apps share 3.8GB RAM
- 6 production apps share 48GB disk
- Any one app can affect others

**Current Usage:**
```
RAM:   2.4 GB / 3.8 GB used (63%)
Disk:  43 GB / 48 GB used (90%)
```

**Risk:**
- If one app has memory leak ‚Üí ALL apps crash
- If disk fills up ‚Üí ALL apps fail
- No isolation between apps

**Docker Implication:**
- Adding Docker will increase resource competition
- Need to be VERY careful about resource limits

---

### **Concern 2: No Swap Space = High Risk**

**Current State:**
```
Swap: 0 GB (NONE!)
```

**Why This Is Critical:**
With **6 production apps** and **NO swap**:
- ‚ùå If RAM runs out, Linux kills random processes
- ‚ùå Could kill FreeScout (users lose access to support)
- ‚ùå Could kill BiScheduler (schools can't schedule)
- ‚ùå Could kill BlockVote (voting system down)
- ‚ùå Could kill Trading Bot (lose money)
- ‚ùå Could kill Odoo API (ERP stops working)

**Recommendation:** ADD SWAP IMMEDIATELY (regardless of Docker)

---

### **Concern 3: Disk Space Critical**

**Current State:**
```
Disk: 90% full (only 4.9GB free)
```

**Why This Is Critical:**
- Linux systems slow down at >85% disk usage
- Databases need space to grow (MySQL logs, temp tables)
- App uploads need space (FreeScout attachments, etc.)
- Logs accumulate daily
- No room for backups

**If disk fills to 100%:**
- ‚ùå ALL apps stop working
- ‚ùå Database crashes
- ‚ùå Can't login to fix it
- ‚ùå Server becomes unusable

**Recommendation:** CLEANUP URGENTLY (regardless of Docker)

---

## üìã REVISED RECOMMENDATION

### **Priority 1: ADD SWAP SPACE (URGENT)** üî¥

**Why:** Protects ALL 6 production apps from crashes
**Risk:** ZERO (safe operation)
**Time:** 15 minutes
**Benefit:** Huge safety improvement
**Recommendation:** DO THIS ASAP

**Commands:**
```bash
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
free -h  # Verify
```

**Impact on Production Apps:** ZERO (nothing restarts)

---

### **Priority 2: SAFE DISK CLEANUP (URGENT)** üü°

**Why:** Disk at 90% is dangerous for ALL apps
**Risk:** LOW (if we're careful)
**Time:** 30-60 minutes
**Benefit:** Frees 2-4 GB, makes system faster
**Recommendation:** DO THIS SOON

**Safe Operations:**
```bash
# 1. Clean package cache (100% safe)
sudo apt-get clean

# 2. Clean old logs (100% safe)
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=7d

# 3. Clean Docker (if you never use it outside of trading)
docker system prune -a  # Only if no other apps use Docker
```

**SKIP for now:**
- `apt-get autoremove` (could affect dependencies)
- Large file deletion (need careful review)

**Impact on Production Apps:** ZERO (only removes cache/logs)

---

### **Priority 3: CAREFUL FILE REVIEW (MEDIUM PRIORITY)** üü¢

**Why:** Might find more space to free
**Risk:** HIGH if not careful
**Time:** 1-2 hours
**Recommendation:** Do together, review each file

**Process:**
1. Find large files
2. Review each one together
3. Only delete if 100% sure it's safe
4. Never touch /var/www/dev/ app data

---

### **Priority 4: DOCKER DEVELOPMENT (LATER)** ‚è∏Ô∏è

**Why:** Wait until resources are more comfortable
**Risk:** Medium (resource competition with other apps)
**Recommendation:** PAUSE Docker work until cleanup done

**Alternative Recommendation:**
Consider a **SEPARATE DROPLET** for Docker development:
- Keeps production apps safe
- No resource competition
- Can experiment freely
- Cost: ~$6-12/month for small droplet

---

## üö® CRITICAL WARNINGS

### **DO NOT DO (High Risk):**

‚ùå **Don't run `apt-get autoremove`** without reviewing what it will remove
‚ùå **Don't delete files in /var/www/dev/** without knowing what they are
‚ùå **Don't restart services** (nginx, php-fpm, mysql) unnecessarily
‚ùå **Don't modify nginx configs** without testing first
‚ùå **Don't fill up disk** (always keep 10% free minimum)

### **BE CAREFUL WITH:**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Log cleanup:** Keep at least 7 days for debugging
‚ö†Ô∏è **Database files:** Never touch mysql data directory
‚ö†Ô∏è **Uploaded files:** FreeScout, BiScheduler may have user uploads
‚ö†Ô∏è **SSL certificates:** Located in /etc/letsencrypt/

### **SAFE TO DO:**

‚úÖ **Add swap space** (zero impact)
‚úÖ **Clean apt cache** (zero impact)
‚úÖ **Clean old journalctl logs** (zero impact)
‚úÖ **Monitor resources** (zero impact)

## ‚ùì QUESTIONS FOR YOU

1. **Did you know this server runs 6 production apps?**
   - Or did you think it was just the trading bot?

2. **Are all these apps critical?**
   - FreeScout, BiScheduler, BlockVote, BCV, Odoo API?
   - Do users depend on them daily?

3. **Can we add swap space?** (Strongly recommended)
   - Zero risk, huge benefit
   - 15 minutes

4. **Can we do safe cleanup?** (apt cache, old logs)
   - Very low risk
   - 30 minutes

5. **For Docker: Prefer separate droplet or upgrade this one?**
   - Separate = safer, better isolation
   - Upgrade = more expensive, all-in-one
