## Paper Trading Features

### Realistic Simulation ✅

**Slippage Model:**
- Random between 0% and 0.02%
- BUY orders pay more (positive slippage)
- SELL orders receive less (negative slippage)
- Total slippage tracked

**Fee Model:**
- Taker fee: 0.05% (market orders)
- Maker fee: 0.02% (limit orders)
- Applied to notional value
- Deducted from balance

**Margin Model:**
- 5× leverage
- Margin = Position Size / Leverage
- Max 80% margin usage
- Locked during position, returned on close

**Example Trade:**
```
Entry: $112,000 (BUY)
Slippage: +$22.40 (0.02%)
Entry with slippage: $112,022.40

Position: 0.00089 BTC ($100)
Margin required: $20
Fee: $0.05

Exit: $113,000 (SELL)
Slippage: -$22.60 (0.02%)
Exit with slippage: $112,977.40

Gross P&L: $85.01
Slippage cost: -$45.00
Fees: -$0.10
Net P&L: $39.91
```
