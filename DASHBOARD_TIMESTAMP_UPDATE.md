**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Requested By:** User

---

## Summary

Enhanced the Trade History display in both the web dashboard and terminal dashboard to show full timestamps (date + time) for each closed trade, making it easier to track when trades occurred.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **Web Dashboard** (`static/js/dashboard.js`)

#### Added Timestamp Display
- Added a new `<div class="trade-timestamp">` element to each trade item
- Displays formatted timestamp showing when the trade was closed

#### Added Format Function
Added `formatTimestamp()` function with smart formatting:
- **Today's trades:** Shows "🕐 Today HH:MM:SS"
- **Yesterday's trades:** Shows "🕐 Yesterday HH:MM"
- **Older trades:** Shows "🕐 Mon DD HH:MM"

Example outputs:
```
🕐 Today 10:16:27
🕐 Yesterday 15:32
🕐 Oct 19 10:23
```

**Files Modified:**
- `static/js/dashboard.js` (lines 217-218, 311-347)

### 2. **Web Dashboard Styling** (`static/css/dashboard.css`)

#### Added CSS Class
Added `.trade-timestamp` class with:
- Smaller font size (0.75rem)
- Dimmed color for subtle appearance
- Monospace font for clean alignment
- Clock emoji for visual indicator

**Files Modified:**
- `static/css/dashboard.css` (lines 481-489)

### 3. **Terminal Dashboard** (`src/monitoring/dashboard.py`)

#### Updated Display Format
Changed from:
```
Closed: 10:16:27
```

To:
```
Closed: 2025-10-20 10:16:27
```

- Shows full date (YYYY-MM-DD) + time (HH:MM:SS)
- Easier to identify when trades occurred
- Better for historical analysis

**Files Modified:**
- `src/monitoring/dashboard.py` (lines 327-332)
