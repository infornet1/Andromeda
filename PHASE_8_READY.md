## üö® Troubleshooting

**Problem: Bot won't start**
```bash
# Check Python version
python3 --version  # Should be 3.8+

# Check venv
ls venv/  # Should exist

# Check config
cat config_live.json  # Should be valid JSON
```

**Problem: No signals generated**
- This is normal! Market may not meet ADX criteria
- ADX must be > 25 (strong trend)
- System is highly selective (97% filter rate)
- Wait for trending market conditions

**Problem: All signals filtered**
- This is GOOD risk management
- System only trades high-probability setups
- Better no trades than bad trades

**Problem: Circuit breaker activated**
- This is WORKING AS DESIGNED
- Protects capital after 3 consecutive losses
- Check logs for reason
- System will not trade until manually reset
